If you're reading this post, you must be wondering about Linux. What it is, who made it and why should you care. I'll help you answer all these questions, but first:

## What exactly is this "Linux" thing?
Many people think Linux is a complete OS in itself, just like Windows or MacOS, but this isn't correct. Linux is just a kernel, known as the Linux Kernel. We need a lot of other components, such as drivers, system utilities, graphical UI, applications, and more, to form a complete operating system. These completed packages are known as _distributions_. 

Some well-known distributions are [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com), [Fedora](https:/fedoraproject.org), [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com), among others. They usually ship with everything you need, such as browsers, file managers, and office suites. However, some software such as Microsoft Office and the Adobe suite are unavailable on Linux-based OSes (at the time of writing). If you really need these, it's best to stick to Windows or MacOS.

## The Linux Story
In 1991, a Finnish computer science student named Linus Torvalds was working on a hobby project in his spare time. He made a kernel and a multithreaded file system, and published it online. This project eventually turned into the Linux project we know today.
