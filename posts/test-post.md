Sui has Mainnet, Devnet, and Testnet networks available. You can use one of the test networks, Devnet or Testnet, to experiment with the version of Sui running on that network. You can also spin up a local Sui network for local development.

The Sui Testnet and Devnet networks consist of several validator nodes to validate each network's transactions. Clients send transactions and read requests via this endpoint: https://fullnode.<SUI-NETWORK-VERSION>.sui.io:443 using JSON-RPC.

You can request test SUI tokens through the Sui devnet-faucet and testnet-faucet Discord channels, depending on which version of the network you use. If connected to Localnet, use cURL to request tokens from your local faucet. The coins on these networks have no financial value. There is no faucet service for Mainnet.
